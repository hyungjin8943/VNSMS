This was a 8 team member project that was done for 2 semester in a software engineering course (CSCI477).
We had a client from UCLA Who is a medical doctor doing a research at Vietanm. 
Our project was keeping track of Vietanm's disease population. 
We used cellphones text to keep track of where a disease is spreading and how many people are being infected. 
When a doctor or researcher text a message with "#" with the name of the disease, our server stores it and represet it on the webpage. 
By having a heatmap, we can visualize easly were the disease is prominent in Vietam.
